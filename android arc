For a note-taking app, here are some key features:

1. **User Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts or sign in with existing credentials to sync their notes across devices.

2. **Note Creation and Editing**: Enable users to create new notes, edit existing ones, and organize them into categories or folders.

3. **Rich Text Formatting**: Support for basic text formatting such as bold, italic, underline, bullet points, numbering, and highlighting.

4. **Attachments**: Allow users to attach files, images, audio recordings, or sketches to their notes.

5. **Sync Across Devices**: Ensure seamless synchronization of notes across multiple devices, including smartphones, tablets, and web browsers.

6. **Search Functionality**: Implement a robust search feature to quickly find specific notes based on keywords or tags.

7. **Reminders and Notifications**: Enable users to set reminders for important notes and receive notifications at specified times.

8. **Offline Access**: Provide offline access to notes, allowing users to view and edit them without an internet connection.

9. **Security**: Implement encryption and other security measures to protect users' sensitive data.

For the architecture and design patterns, you could consider using:

1. **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: This architecture separates the user interface(UI) from the business logic and data manipulation, promoting better code organization and testability.

2. **Room Persistence Library**: Use Room to handle local data storage and database operations, making it easier to manage and access user-generated content.

3. **Retrofit**: Utilize Retrofit for making network requests and interacting with a backend server for user authentication and synchronization.

4. **LiveData and ViewModel**: LiveData can be used to observe changes in data and update the UI accordingly, while ViewModel retains UI-related data across configuration changes.

5. **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Implement DI with Dagger or Hilt to improve code maintainability, scalability, and testability by decoupling dependencies.

6. **Coroutine**: Use Kotlin Coroutines for managing asynchronous operations such as network requests and database transactions, leading to more concise and readable code.

For testing strategy:

1. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for individual components such as ViewModel, Repository, and Data Access Objects (DAOs) using frameworks like JUnit and Mockito.

2. **Integration Testing**: Perform integration tests to verify the interaction between different layers of the app, including database operations and network requests.

3. **UI Testing**: Use Espresso or UI Automator to write UI tests that simulate user interactions and verify the correctness of UI elements and functionalities.

4. **Device Compatibility Testing**: Test the app on a variety of Android devices with different screen sizes, resolutions, and hardware configurations to ensure compatibility and consistent performance.

5. **Regression Testing**: Continuously run regression tests to identify and fix any issues introduced by new code changes or updates.

By following these practices and leveraging the recommended tools and design patterns, you can efficiently develop a robust and user-friendly note-taking app for Android.
